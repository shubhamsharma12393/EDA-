# EDA-
Dataset recording people to invest in each other in a way that is financially and socially rewarding. On loans, borrowers list loan requests between $ 2,000 and $ 35,000, and individual investors invest as little as $ 25 in each loan listing they select. Prosper handles the servicing of the loan on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors. Few more different questions were also included in that mini-project not based on a summary.
